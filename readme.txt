this is a flask website which is a stand-alone display of the 
wikipedia 'today's featured picture' which is down the 
wikipedia main page:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
wikipedia has its own stand-alone display:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:POTD_protected

the inspiration for this project is from exploring the 
wikipedia API, the main page of which is:
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page

there, I found a tutorial with python and flask code to 
build a 'Picture of the day viewer'. Since this only
retrieved the picture and not the caption, I took another
approach and found scraping code which I used to 
scrape wikipedia's stand-alone page.

The only advantage of this project over wikipedia's page is that 
the picture is larger.
